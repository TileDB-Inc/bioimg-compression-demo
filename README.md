# Background

This repository contains a demonstration of the conversion of an Aperio format SVS image into a TileDB multi-resolution array group using the [TileDB BioImg](https://pypi.org/project/tiledb-bioimg/) library. We compare the compressed image size to that of the original with lossy compression applied in both cases.

The source data for this demo comes from the OpenSlide data repository: https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Aperio/ ([image link](https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Aperio/JP2K-33003-2.svs)).

# Setup

To run the full demo, please clone this git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/bioimg-compression-demo
```

We have included a conda environment with all dependencies for this demo. After installing [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) (recommended) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), create the test environment using:

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
# or
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Alternatively, all packages are available on PyPI:
```
pip install tiledb openslide-python tiledb-bioimg
```

Activate the environment created above:

```
conda activate bioimg-compression-demo
```

# Execution

After activating the python environment, run the demo script within the repository directory:

```
cd bioimg-compression-demo

python demo.py
```

# Comparison

We have converted the SVS image to a group of TileDB arrays stored with *lossy* WebP compression at quality=70%.

## Original SVS file

The original file size is 276MB:

```
-rw-r--r--@  1 inorton  staff   276M Apr 27 08:51 JP2K-33003-2.svs
```

The file is stored with JPEG2000 compression, with lossy compression applied at quality factor 70% (Q=70):

## Converted TileDB image

The converted TileDB bioimage array size is:

```
img-compression-demo ‚ùØ du -sh JP2K-33003-2.tiledb
200M	JP2K-33003-2.tiledb
```

Note that this conversion includes the 3 pyramidal layers, but not the two additional TIFF pages with `Subfile Type: reduced-resolution image` in the TIFF file, however those TIFF pages are very small so the file sizes here are dominated by the high-resolution levels.

# Discussion

In this demo we have converted an Aperio SVS image into a TileDB multi-resolution array group with similar compression settings to the original. There is room to increase the Q factor for the TileDB array to save with higher quality if needed.
